Q1.
    In order to avoid starvation our field does not allow one sport to play
    back-to-back. It does this by the field struct containing a value known 
    as "currentSport". Each sport has a set of associated functions that will
    check to see if it is that sports turn on the field. Then when that sport 
    leaves the field currentSport is incremented and modulo-ed with 3 in order
    to be within the bounds of the sport types (0-2) which are enumerated for 
    readability.

Q2.
    In order to test for synchronization we have a few extra print statements for
    when players are moving on and off the field. We also have print statements to 
    to see when they are moving onto the fiedl so a baseball player is not entering
    the field during a football game for example.
